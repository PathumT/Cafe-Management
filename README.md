catch 35


Problem –
Colombo restaurant Cafe 35 doesn't have an online presence, which means it's missing out on opportunities to boost sales
and engage customers. To ensure their customers' safety in the wake of the global pandemic, restaurants must now provide
online ordering and table reservation services. The lack of a web application makes it difficult for the restaurant to offer
these crucial services, which puts them behind their rivals in the market.




Solution-
Creating a user-friendly and effective web application for Cafe 35 that will allow customers to place orders online, book
tables, and browse the menu without any difficulty. Customers will be able to interact with the restaurant in a safe and
convenient way thanks to the app, which will boost sales and improve patron satisfaction. The restaurant will be able to
customize its menu and services to meet the needs of its customers thanks to the web application's useful data and
insights.


 Table Reservation System is to allow the restaurant to manage its
resources better, plan ahead, and optimize its seating capacity. By knowing in
advance how many tables are reserved and at what times, the restaurant can prepare
accordingly, ensure that the right number of staff members are on duty, and avoid
overbooking or under booking tables.
Flow: The user accesses the web application's table reservation page and completes
the reservation form, which includes questions about the preferred date, time, number
of seats, and any other pertinent information. Following form submission, the user is
required to authenticate themselves using an SMS OTP that is sent to the mobile
number they provided. The user is directed to the checkout page, where they can
review their reservation details and confirm the reservation, after entering the correct
OTP. The total cost of the reservation, including any applicable fees or taxes, is also
shown on the checkout page.
Good practices:
§ Have a meaningful title for the interface.
§ Ensure that an interface has only one primary focus. Avoid doing multiple tasks from a
single interface.
§ Keep the interfaces simple. An interface should not contain irrelevant information.
§ Ensure that the users do not have to think or work too hard to use an interface.


Purpose : The page allows users to view their ongoing and previous reservations,
make modifications or cancellations if necessary, and search for specific reservations
based on date or other criteria.
Flow: Once on the page, customers can view all of their ongoing and previous
reservations in one place. The ongoing reservations are displayed first, providing an
overview of the customer's current reservations. Customers can click on a specific
reservation to view the reservation details, including the reservation date, time, and
location. From there, customers can make modifications or cancellations to their
ongoing reservations if necessary.
Below the ongoing reservations, the Reservation Management Page displays all of
the user's previous reservations. Customers can click on a specific reservation to view
the reservation details, such as the reservation date, time, and location. The search
bar and date filter enable customers to quickly and easily find specific reservations
based on date or other criteria. The dropdown allows customers to filter between
ongoing and previous reservations, making it easier to locate specific reservations.
Good practices

Purpose : Customers of Cafe 35 can conveniently change or cancel their reservations
online thanks to the Reservation Modification Page. Customers can view any
applicable charges before confirming the edits, edit the reservation details, and, if
necessary, canceling ongoing reservations on this page. By providing this service,
Cafe 35 can give their clients more freedom in managing their reservations and lower
the possibility of no-shows.
Flow: By selecting the edit button on the reservation management page, a customer
can get to the reservation modification page to change or cancel their reservation.
Customers can change the reservation's date, time, or location once they've landed
on the page. The customer may also cancel a reservation that is already in progress.
The customer can review the changes and charges before clicking the confirm button
to complete the edits. The web application displays any additional fees, if applicable.
After the customer approves the changes to the reservation, the web application
securely processes the payment and sends the customer a confirmation email or SMS
with all the pertinent information, including the modified reservation date, time, and
location.
